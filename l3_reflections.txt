When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you might need other people to see it and collaborate more easily

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	by pulling manullly, we can decide when to merge remote changes rather than allowing git to merge something without our knoweledge. 
	This might cause the code to malfunction as it might not be entirely functional or compilable.
