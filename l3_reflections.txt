When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you might need other people to see it and collaborate more easily

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	by pulling manullly, we can decide when to merge remote changes rather than allowing git to merge something without our knoweledge. 
	This might cause the code to malfunction as it might not be entirely functional or compilable.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks give credit to original creator of the repo and only copy it onto your github repo and not your pc. clones are to make a copy of the 
	repo onto your computer. branches are to diverge within the copy of code on your computer

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	by doing so, we can look at the code offline and see which changes to merge into master branch or whether to merge it at all.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Without git or github, I would probably use only email to collaborate with others. It would be much easier with git, as it would be 
	easy to track changes,fix conflicts and experiment changes. The only hard thing would be to make sure others know how to use git as well

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	I would do it whenever I'm working on a feature that needs the approval of other collaborators on the project. It also helps to test out new 
	features.Using only the master branch makes the workflow a lot simpler as we don't have to deal with pull requests and merge conflicts 
	always.
