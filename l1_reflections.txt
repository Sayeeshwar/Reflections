So we can use git diff to view the difference between files.

Or we can use fc in command prompt for this. + indicates new

additions and - indicates deletions

Having the entire history of code that you might be working on,
might help you find out where exactly you went wrong and help
you correct yourself from your past mistakes

Difference between auto commits like google docs and 
Wikipedia is that auto commits could not make sense as they
might not be complete at the time of commit. While this reduces
user error, it doesnt have flexibility

Manual commits have much more flexibility, as its upto us to
commit each time a logical change is made. However, forgetting
to commit is also on us.

Git is more oriented towards code version control, where its
important to track multiple files. However, Docs is intended to 
allow creation of seperate files and isn't intended for version
control.

git log --stat can be used to view changes in each commit. 
git diff id 1 id 2 can also be used for the same purpose.

git clone url can be used to clone files from a remote repo,
with all its commits and changes.

git checkout helps you goto a past state of things where the 
files were different. This helps a lot as you can see what the
changes were between 2 versions where a bug could've been
introduced. Also, note down the latest commit's id, if you want 
to restore your latest state of the files.

Now that you have your workspace set up, 
what do you want to try using Git for?

I didnt get my workspace completely set up as i didnt set the
shortcut for the text editor.

I'd like to use git to upload my projexts across all languages
and topics
